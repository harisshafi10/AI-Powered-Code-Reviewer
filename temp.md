❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a +b}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope. This will likely result in an error (ReferenceError) when the
function is executed, as the interpreter will look for variables `a` and `b` in the outer scope (which may or may not
exist).
* ❌ The function should accept arguments to sum. Without arguments, it's not reusable or predictable.
* ❌ Missing semicolon at the end of the statement (although JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion might handle this
in some cases, it's best practice to include them explicitly).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ Takes `a` and `b` as parameters, making the function reusable and predictable.
* ✔️ Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
* ✔️ Includes a semicolon for clarity and best practice.

Final Note:

Always make sure that your functions receive the necessary input as parameters and that all variables used within the
function are properly defined, either as parameters or within the function's scope. This prevents unexpected errors and
makes your code much easier to understand and maintain. Consider adding input validation for production code.
